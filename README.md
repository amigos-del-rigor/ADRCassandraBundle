## Deprecated ##

[phpcassa](https://github.com/thobbs/phpcassa) has been deprecated and so is this bundle.
If you want to integrate newer versions of Cassandra in your PHP/Symfony projects please check out the new PHP driver located here: https://github.com/datastax/php-driver (supporting CQL and many other goods) and a new Cassandra bundle using it located here: https://github.com/M6Web/CassandraBundle
